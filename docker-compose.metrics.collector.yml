  # When using the Collector pattern, do NOT map the Newt admin/metrics port
  # (2112) on the application service. Mapping 2112 here can cause port
  # conflicts and may result in duplicated Prometheus scraping (app AND
  # collector being scraped for the same metrics). Instead either:
  #  - leave ports unset on the app service (recommended), or
  #  - map 2112 only on a dedicated metrics/collector service that is
  #    responsible for exposing metrics to Prometheus.
  # Example: do NOT map here
  # ports: []
  # Example: map 2112 only on a collector service
  # collector:
  #   ports:
  #     - "2112:2112"  # collector's prometheus exporter (scraped by Prometheus)
